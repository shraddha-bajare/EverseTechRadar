# SKAO Technology Watch

## Introduction

The SKAO Technology Watch is part of an ongoing initiative by the [Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO)](https://www.skao.int/) to showcase, monitor, and promote the adoption of technologies that support the Observatory’s software, infrastructure, and data-driven development strategies.

## What is the SKAO Technology Watch?

It includes a [catalogue of tools, platforms, and practices](#segments-and-rings) used or considered by SKAO software engineering teams, organised through a [visual Technology watch](#technology-watch-dashboard). The watch tracks the maturity, and strategic alignment of each entry to help guide technical decision-making across software engineering, platform infrastructure, collaboration, and data processing domains.

Rather than attempting to cover every available tool, the watch highlights a curated set of technologies that have been evaluated based on SKAO's goals for secure, scalable, and maintainable engineering practices.

## Segments and Rings

### Segments

The watch is divided into four thematic **segments**, which reflect SKAO’s core areas of technological development:

- **Software Engineering & Development Practices**  
  Tools, languages, and frameworks that support software engineering for scalable, maintainable, and testable softwares.

- **Infrastructure & Platform Engineering**  
  Platforms, orchestration tools, and infrastructure management technologies used to deploy, operate, and monitor systems at scale.

- **Collaboration Platform**  
  Systems and practices that support agile workflows, documentation, team collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

- **Data Processing**  
  Tools, frameworks, and patterns for handling large-scale data workflows.

### Rings

The watch also categorises technologies by their **adoption stage** using concentric rings:

- **Adopt**  
  Mature and widely used tools recommended for use in SKAO projects. These have strong community support, strategic relevance, and a proven track record.

- **Trial**  
  Promising technologies under active evaluation. Suitable for pilot projects or controlled rollouts to determine long-term viability.

- **Hold**  
  Tools not recommended for new projects, often due to maturity, relevance, or strategic misalignment. Existing usage may be phased out.

These rings help guide technology selection based on current confidence, support, and strategic fit.
