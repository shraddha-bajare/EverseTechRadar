# SKAO Technology Watch

The **SKAO Technology Watch** is a curated [catalog of _tools, platforms, and practices_](#technology-catalog) that support SKAOâ€™s software engineering, infrastructure, and data processing operations. It includes a visual [Technology Watch Dashboard](#technology-radar-dashboard) that helps track the adoption status and maturity of key technologies used across the SKAO Observatory.

## Technology Catalog

This catalog includes technologies that meet the unique and demanding requirements of large-scale, collaborative science infrastructure such as the SKA Observatory. Examples include:

- Tools and services used for software development, CI/CD, infrastructure management, and data processing.
- Frameworks that enable secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions across distributed environments.
- Collaborative platforms and agile tooling that support communication and knowledge sharing across teams.
- Technologies aligned with FAIR principles, reproducibility, sustainability, and long-term software lifecycle goals.

Each item is reviewed and classified by SKAO engineers and contributors based on usage experience and strategic fit.
